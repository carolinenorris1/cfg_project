            "This app changed my life. I've been working from home since Covid and am on my computer all day. I'd been getting eye strain, and had read about the 20x20x20 rule, but would always get so absorbed in my work that I'd forget to look away from the screen. Then someone told me about UnHook. The gentle reminders are all I need, and it's fantastic just to be able to relax & focus on my work without having to worry about ruining my eyes. I recommend you to everyone!"

The inbuilt features mean I don't have to have a ton on tabs open. All in all, a very useful app that helps me declutter and stay focused."

            "The best on the market I've tried out quite a few wellbeing apps but this one is by far my favourite. I'm in a much better routine when working from my computer now and I love that I can customise the sound of the alarm. I would definitely recommend paying a little extra for the premium version - the wrist and neck stretches have made a huge difference for me.

              Working from home, or a home-from-home anywhere in the world, can be great, but it can also lead to feelings of isolation, loneliness and stress. Here at UnHook, we believe home working should work for everyone, that's why our members' community hub is full of the latest and greatest events near you. Find out what your fellow homeworkers are up to and definitely make plans to get out there this weekend...
