## Description
Unhook is a website and app dedicated to improving the physical and mental health of home workers. Created and built, by an all female team from the Code First Girls full stack micro degree as their final project. 

As newcomers to the world of coding, we have all found that hours of screentime, learning new topics, whilst informative, comes with some negative effects for your health in the form of eye strain and joint and muscle pain. This is where the idea for this project came from. We wanted a way for home workers to improve their working practices and  environment and manage their screen time effectively.

The website consists of four pages, an introductory homepage, a page which will contain information about good working practices and advice on how to make healthy choices. The third page showcases our app features and the last page contains sections for the unhook community.

The principle features of the app are: the eye timer, which allows you to customise and set an alarm to remind you to take screen breaks. Music players utilising apis to manage your sound and guided meditations. Hosted links for stretches and a motivational quote for the day to boost your mood.
